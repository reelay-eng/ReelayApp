# Reelay

To build Reelay, clone the repo onto your machine, cd into the directory, and run `yarn install`.

Once yarn has finished installing packages, run `amplify pull` to get the latest configuration from amplify.

Run the app for development using `yarn start`.

Build the app using `expo build:ios` and `expo build:android` and publish them to their respective stores using on-screen instructions.
