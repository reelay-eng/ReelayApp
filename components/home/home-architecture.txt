I think that you could structure the "scaffolding" of your app differently


function AuthenticatedApp() {
    return (
        <View>
            {/* here you want things that are going to exist regardless of the screen */ }
            { /* As you have an AuthenticatedContext, you can then pass back }
            <ProfileButton/>
            <Header />
            <AuthenticatedNavigator />
        </View>
    )
}
