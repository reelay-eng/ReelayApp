react -->

F (state) = output. 


Everytime you change state, you change a render. 

React = F

F (state) ==> 

{
    element: Div,
    id, 
    ref: reference to the underlying dom div,
    metadata:
    parent: reference to the parent element
    children: [
        {
            element: Div,
            invalidated

        }
    ]
    props: { 

    }
}

React does some magic --> 

React Native
React DOM
React VR

Leverage underlying APIs to render.
